      The inspiration of our application is to help college students collaborate more efficiently and have more meaningful meetings with their professor.
A lot of the time, students enroll in a course and are put in an awkward position where they do not know any of their peers or teacher. 
This awkward situation can cause for students to feel less involved in the course, which hurts the learning environment, especially in lecture where questions and ideas are encouraged.  
Thus, we desire to target college students and professors who will benefit from an open and educational environment. Through our application, we plan to help students collaborate and ask questions that can be answered by peers or TA's/professors alike. 
We plan to create an open and social environment where students can help their peers and get to know each other better.
Once students are more familar with each other, this can vastly improve then learning environment for all students in the course by making everyone feel more comfortable with sharing their ideas.
