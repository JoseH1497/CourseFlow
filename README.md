# 1) App Description: 
The goal of our application is to create virtual communities among students that have the same classes and to provide them with several forms of communications which they can use to collaborate and help one another. Our application follows the doctrine that collaboration is the best way to solidify knowledge. With that said, it is easy to see that both people who are using our application to share their knowledge and people who are using it to seek knowledge can benefit equally by using our product. More specifically our application will provide each class with a forum where students will be free to post any thoughts, problems and concerns related to a class' subject. However, the strength of our product comes from the ability for students to see who else is at the moment using the application. Students can then request to collaborate with one another either by revealing their identity or choosing to stay anonymous. In addition, our product will provide students with the ability to upload their class notes if they feel like they would be beneficial to other fellow classmates.


# 2) App Design:

CourseFlow increases student engagement through an open forum. Students can post either as themselves, or as an anonymous user, and answer questions the same. Being able to post anonymously is an important part of CourseFlow, as some users might be too shy to post openly, and being able to engage the class without their name being attached to their posts and comments will encourage posting. Users recieve points for posting, which encourages asking and answering questions, and encourages discussion amongst the group. An automoderator function keeps innapropriate content from being posted, and teachers and administrators can pierce the veil of anonymity to see who posted a comment, as well. Teachers or administrators can host office hours online through CourseFlow, where students recieve help in priority determined by their points: users with more points get more priority, but cannot hog all of the time.


# 3) Users:
      
The inspiration of our application is to help college students collaborate more efficiently and have more meaningful meetings with their professor.
A lot of the time, students enroll in a course and are put in an awkward position where they do not know any of their peers or teacher(s). 
This awkward situation can cause for students to feel less involved in the course, which hurts the learning environment, especially in lecture where questions and ideas are encouraged.  
Thus, we desire to target college students and professors who will benefit from an open and educational environment. Through our application, we plan to take away the intimidation factor many students feel when they enroll in a course where they do not know many of their peers.
We plan to create an educational and social environment where students can help their peers and get to know each other better.
Once students are more familar with each other, this can vastly improve then learning environment for all students in the course by making everyone feel more comfortable with sharing their ideas.
  


# 4) Impact:

CourseFlow will increase connectivity and collaboration between students. This will help students achieve higher grades, while also developing important communication skills. Increased collaboration increases the bonds between a community of students, which will lead to increased engagement.
